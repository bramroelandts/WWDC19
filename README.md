# WWDC19 scholarship submission (didn't win)

Every year, **Apple** selects 350 students worldwide who are given the chance to attend the infamous worldwide developers conference, **WWDC**, in San Jose, fully free of charge. Applicants are judged on a coding submission and written essays.


## My 2019 submission

My submission is built around calculating mathematical constants, like `Pi`, `e` and the `golden ratio`. To be able to calculate these constants with thousands of digits of precision, some behind-the-scenes tooling was required. It all comes together in a vintage 1980s Macintosh.
